# Onigiri Town's Art Generation Tool (Open-Sourced)

Onigiri Town is a cozy community built on Solana. For more information, please see our [website](https://www.onigiritown.com/).

## Instructions

1. Create directory structure

Have a `trait-layers` folder that contains one subfolder for each attribute type. For example, if you look at this project's [trait-layers](trait-layers/), you will see seven different subfolders:

- background
- cheeks
- eyes
- front
- headpiece
- mouth
- rice
